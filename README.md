# Repository Overview

This repository contains data, analysis scripts, and visualizations associated with a scientific study on **macroinvertebrate communities in naturally occurring RPBS mesohabitats from warm-temperate rivers**. The materials support the findings and methods reported in a manuscript prepared for submission to a scientific journal.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to provide a transparent and reproducible framework for:

- **Data organization and preprocessing:** Handling raw macroinvertebrate community and trait data.  
- **Statistical analyses:** Performing self-organizing maps (SOM), indicator taxa analyses, and community structure analyses.  
- **Trait-based insights:** Exploring the ecological roles of invertebrate traits in naturally occurring repeated habitat structures in streams and rivers.  
- **Visualization:** Generating figures and plots to communicate patterns in macroinvertebrate communities effectively.  
- **Reproducibility:** Allowing other researchers to reproduce the analyses and explore the dataset independently.

## Contents

- `data/` – Raw and processed datasets used for analyses.  
- `code/` – R or Python scripts used for data cleaning, SOM, indicator taxa, community analyses, and figure generation.  
- `figures/` – Output figures generated from the analysis.  
- `README.md` – Overview of the repository, its purpose, and instructions.

## Usage

This repository is intended for academic and research purposes. Users can:

1. Explore the macroinvertebrate datasets.  
2. Run the analysis scripts.  
3. Reproduce the figures and results reported in the corresponding manuscript.

## Notes

- All data provided comply with relevant ethical and legal standards.  
- The repository is structured to facilitate reproducibility and transparency in ecological research.
